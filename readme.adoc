== Description

[WARNING]
====
Since gitea does not support relative links for asciidoc files, I have used
absolute links instead. This means that they will not work for mirrors.
====

This repository holds my custom shell scripts.

=== Contents

==== https://src.reticentadmin.com/aryan/shell-scripts/src/branch/main/system-scripts[system-scripts]
The scripts found here are mostly QoL automation scripts that are deployed on my systems.

==== https://src.reticentadmin.com/aryan/shell-scripts/src/branch/main/other-scripts[other-scripts]
The scripts listed here are obtained from my other git repositories for
organisational purposes. These should **not** be run outside their respective
environments.
